This is a stupid simple Rails app to return a random image from Flickr's http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/ feed.

There was absolutely no need to do this in Rails since the meat of the code is all of 4 lines, but I happend to be in a ruby mood and not a javascript one.

Running on Heroku, try it out: http://random-flickr-image.herokuapp.com

What little code that is mine is [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/). Technically, this is a web scrapper and may or may not violate Flickr's TOS, so please use this only for good. :)
